/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Saved by the bell" application.
 * "The BlueJ Odyssey" is an intense, time-dependent, text-based game.
 * Its objective is to walk through the different rooms to go to the examination hall in time for the exam.
 * However, the player should also take into account variables such as comfort and stress, since they will play a role
 * in the outcome of the game.
 *
 * The amount of time available will be dependent on the difficulty chosen by the player, having more time the easier options.
 *
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 *
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all the managers, which initialise their corresponding fields,
 *  creates the parser and starts the game.
