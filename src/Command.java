/**
 * Command class for "Saved by the Bell" game.
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command currently consists of two or three strings: a command word and up to two more words
 * that represent the parameter.
 *
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <null>.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second and third words are <null>.
