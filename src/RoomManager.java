/**
 * This is the RoomManager class for "Saved by the bell".
 *
 * It is in charge of setting up and storing all the rooms in the game
 * with their corresponding fields, which include name, description, available actions,
 * exits, and the items and characters that are contained in it.
 *
 * It also has specialised collections for the stations, which will be useful whenever the player has to travel back
 * and forth between them.
 *
 * The class requires instances of the ItemManager and CharacterManager classes in order to set up with their
 * corresponding content.
 *
 * It creates an instance of the CharacterManager class after the constructor in order to set the main character first,
 * avoiding potential Null Pointer Exceptions. This also occurs with the ItemManager class.
