/**
 * Main Character class for "Saved by the bell" game.
 *
 * This is a child of the Character class, which stores all the information
 * and actions that the player can take throughout the course of the game.
 *
 * This class differs from its parent class in the fact that it includes
 * more fields that are important to progress throughout the game. This includes
 * clothesOn, which is initialised as false (thus not letting the player move to other places
 * apart from the bed, room and bathroom) or hasOyster (necessary to use the transport services).
 * Additionally, it also stores an instance of the game's Room Manager, in order to navigate across the map.
 *
 * Lastly, if has variables such as stress and comfort that will affect the outcome of the game and vary
 * depending on the choices the player makes.
 *
 * It also includes methods to interact with objects and people, as well as buying items.
