/**
 * This is the ItemManager class for "Saved by the bell".
 *
 * It is in charge of setting up and storing all the items in the game
 * with their corresponding fields, which include name, status, if it can be taken,
 * weight and also the action that takes place whenever they are used.
 *
 * The class requires instances of the RoomManager and CharacterManager classes in order to set the items in relation
 * to the different rooms and characters in the game.
 *
 *The last field mentioned utilises the self-made Action interface, which holds the method run(), that will
 * execute whenever an item is used.
